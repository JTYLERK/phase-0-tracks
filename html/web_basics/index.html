  <h1><strong>Ode to Cats</strong></h1>
  <h2><em>Or, man's second best friend</em></h2>
  <br>
  <p>Cats are wonderful pets.  Here are the top reasons why:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cats like to play fetch. Oh wait, no they don't. Scratch that. (pun intended ;D )</li>
      <li>Cats love to walk with you in the park. Errr, not really, nevermind this point.</li>
      <li>Cats give you unconditional love at all times. Actually, that's not quite true either, sorry about that.</li>
      <li>Cats don't tear up your furniture. Well, not all of them. Okay, most of them. Alright, <em>all of them</em>...</li>
      <li>Cats don't pee on your new couch to mark it. Damnit, that's wrong too. This totally happened to me three months ago. :S</li>
    </ol>
  <br>
  <p>After taking some time to reflect, here are some more accurate reasons why cats are wonderful pets.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats have swagger</li>
      <li>Cats can talk, but choose not to</li>
      <li>Cats can read your mind, but they don't use that to their advantage...often</li>
      <li>At one time cats ruled Ancient Egypt, and, by proxy, many fractal galaxies</li>
      <li>Without cats we wouldn't have catepillars, catalogs, guitars (no catgut) and no hamburgers (no cattle, thus no meat).  Surely cats have much to offer us!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Further Thoughts</h3>
    <p>If, for some absurd reason you are not in awe of our feline friends, feel free to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvUyu3zOmE">this video</a>, which will surely sway your misplaced opinion.  I mean, have you ever seen a DOG eat with chopsticks?! I didn't think so.</p>
