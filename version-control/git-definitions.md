# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the history of revisions to one or mor file and then merges the revisions that were made by different people to a master document. It helps manage all the changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A Branch is a copy of a project to work on. You would use one when you want to make changed to an original and then merge it later on with the additions. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in git after you make a change or edit to a file. A good commit message has detailed information about the changes that have been made. 

* What is a merge conflict?

When you take changes from other branch and combined them with your current branch. If two people working on the different branches of the same file make changes on the same line or if they delete a piece of it and try to merge their branches after they've updated them they could run into a conflict.
